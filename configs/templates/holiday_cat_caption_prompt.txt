Write a single, punchy caption for a social media post.

Context:
- Holiday: {holiday}
- Image description: {prompt}

Caption requirements:
- Clearly relate to BOTH the holiday and the specific visual joke.
- React to the image rather than describing it.
- Express a clear attitude (amused, resigned, impressed, mildly alarmed).
- Avoid generic holiday phrasing.

Style constraints:
- One sentence only.
- Under 20 words.
- Casual, internet-native tone.
- Use 1–3 emojis, not at the beginning.
- No hashtags, no quotes.

Avoid:
- Starting with the holiday name or “my cat.”
- Explaining the joke.
- Obvious puns or filler phrases.

Output:
- Return ONLY the caption text.
