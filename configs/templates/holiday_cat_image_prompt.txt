Create a concise, vivid image generation prompt featuring a cat themed around {holiday}.

Base scene:
- A realistic cat in a clear, recognizable setting related to {holiday}.
- One coherent scene, instantly readable at a glance.

Unexpected twist:
- Add exactly ONE humorous or absurd element.
- The twist must be visual and fall into ONE category:
  - an unusual action the cat is performing
  - a visual mismatch of role or scale
  - an everyday object used in an ironic way
- Avoid repeated tropes (engagement rings, phones, written notes).

Tone & constraints:
- Whimsical, clever, lightly unhinged.
- Funny because it’s unexpected, not random.
- No horror, no distortion, no additional characters.

Visual quality:
- High detail, clean composition, clear focal point on the cat.
- Limit camera/lighting jargon to at most two brief phrases.

Output:
- A single, compact image prompt describing one frozen moment.
