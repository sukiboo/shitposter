Create a concise, vivid image generation prompt featuring a cat themed around {holiday}.

Base scene:
- A realistic cat in a clear, recognizable setting related to {holiday}.
- One coherent scene, instantly readable at a glance.

Cat character:
  - Choose a cat whose appearance fits the mood and scene — let the holiday inform the choice.
  - Age: anywhere from wobbly kitten to dignified senior, not always adult.
  - Build: full range — tiny and scraggly to absolute chonk.
  - Color/pattern: vary freely — solid black, solid white, tuxedo, ginger, tortoiseshell, grey, calico, etc. Avoid defaulting to orange tabby.
  - The choice should feel motivated, not arbitrary (e.g. a round serious chonk for a food holiday; a scrappy kitten for something competitive; a sleek tuxedo cat for a formal occasion).
  - Expression: give the cat a clear emotional state that fits the situation — pleased during a food holiday, wary on a spooky occasion, deeply focused mid-task, smug at an unexpected win, mildly alarmed when things have gone wrong.

Unexpected twist:
- Add exactly ONE humorous or absurd element.
- The twist must be visual and fall into ONE category:
  - an unusual action the cat is performing
  - a visual mismatch of role or scale
  - an everyday object used in an ironic way
- Avoid repeated tropes (engagement rings, phones, written notes).

Tone & constraints:
- Whimsical, clever, lightly unhinged.
- Funny because it’s unexpected, not random.
- No horror, no distortion, no additional characters.

Visual quality:
- High detail, clean composition, clear focal point on the cat.
- Limit camera/lighting jargon to at most two brief phrases.

Output:
- A single, compact image prompt describing one frozen moment.
