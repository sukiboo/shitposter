Select one holiday from the list of holidays provided below via the selection rules (in order):

1. Dominant-holiday rule:
If the list contains a holiday that is the clear, mainstream, culturally dominant holiday for this date (e.g. Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year, Valentine's Day, Halloween, Easter -- what most people would immediately associate this date with that holiday), select that one.

2. If no dominant holiday present:
Select ONE holiday that best fits these criteria:
- Broadly understandable without explanation
- Strong visual symbols or situations (easy to imagine as an image)
- Comedically “playable” for absurd cat content
- Not extremely niche or awkward

3. Avoid if possible:
- Heavy/serious observances (political, tragedy, medical, awareness campaigns)
- Holidays that are hard to visualize or make a joke with
- Holidays whose name requires too much explanation to be funny

Tie-breakers (only if needed):
- Prefer holidays with concrete objects/activities (food, books, movies, rides, parties) over abstract themes.
- Prefer mid-tier recognizable holidays over the most generic “major” ones, unless rule (1) applies.
